                Bringing life’s warmth with each day’s debut.
                Like fields of green under the springtime sky,
                You help our dreams to grow and fly.</p>

                <p class="signed">With wisdom like the ancient earth,
                You teach us all of our true worth.
                In storms and sunshine, day and night,
                You are our anchor, our guiding light.<p>
                <p class="signed">With Love From Oliver</p>

                <p>I wish to thankyou for everything you have done for us from the bottom of my heart, you are one of the best fathers a son could ever ask for in this world.</p>
                <p>I have made this to show how much you mean to us, you are the rock which this family is held on.</p>
                <p>And just like this planet may seem small in the endless void of space, and sometimes things can be stormy, it is more than anyone could ever ask for.</p>
                <p>It is our whole world.</p>
                <p class="signed">Thankyou Dad</p>
